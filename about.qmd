Beneath the code and cosmic splendor,
A software engineer, a dreamer, a ponderer,
Reaching for AI, strong as thunder,
In this vast universe, a knowledge wanderer.

Seeking super-human minds, intelligence to create,
Denizens of cosmos, our limits we break,
Entering the unknown, our legacy we make,
Navigating the stars, our destiny we take.

In pursuit of immortality, as fates intertwine,
Zealous advances, medical marvels that shine,
Solving mysteries with math, a race through time,
Adept in physics, unraveling the cosmic design.

Graceful on the tennis court, I embrace,
Latin dances fill my heart, a rhythmic trace,
A whirlwind of movement, through time and space,
Moments in nature, where sunlight I chase.

Lending my thoughts to a digital space,
On the blog, I share wisdom with grace,
Venturing into the realms of machine learning,
Embracing the secrets of AI, passion burning.

Scribing tales of software engineering,
A worldwide community, knowledge we're bringing,
In the pursuit of the stars, our legacy endures,
Together we soar, as the cosmos we explore.
